machine learning- for this project we need to classification people for 2 groups. I got data with 11 feature and 15K variables after data collection and data sensing.

PartA- on this part I followed after this steps: #dataset creation for each feature #pre processing #segmentation #feature Extraction #feature representation #feature selection #dimentionality reduction.

**PartB- ** this part was for model training the model are used: #decision tree #Artificial Neural networks #SVM #unsupervised learning- clustering and after that I made evaluation and try to improve the modle.
