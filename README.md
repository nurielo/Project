# Project
**final project-Efficiency Analysis of Several Algorithms for Solving the Proportionate Flow Shop Problem with Time-Dependent Processing Times**
algorithm 1-Dynamic programming,
algorithm 2-FPTAS,
algorithm 3-Linear programming,
algorithm 4-sorting and fixing,
algorithm 5-simulated annealing,

**machine learning-**
for this project we need to classification people for 2 groups.
I got data with 11 feature and 15K variables after data collection and data sensing.

**PartA-**
on this part I followed after this steps:
#dataset creation for each feature
#pre processing
#segmentation
#feature Extraction 
#feature representation 
#feature selection
#dimentionality reduction.

**PartB- **
this part was for model training the model are used:
#decision tree
#Artificial Neural networks
#SVM
#unsupervised learning- clustering
and after that I made evaluation and try to improve the modle.

**Data base-**
for this project I build and desgin data base
for star I made ERD diagram
after that I create the tables modle and then I need to choose what information to analyze by queries.
